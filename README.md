# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise wants to create a Kickstarter campaign to fund her play. She was seeking trends in other campaigns that would help her to crowdsource the estimated $10,000+ funding needed for her project. The trends were identified by an analysis of data from past Kickstarters, reviewing both successful and failed campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The based on the number of successful theatre Kickstarters, the best month to launch a campaign is May. Contrary to that, December was the month with the fewest number of successful theatre Kickstarter launches. Although May also had 17 more failed launches than December, it had 74 greater successful launches than December. Through similar analysis of the other months, two conclusions can be drawn: May is the best month to launch, and December is the worst month to launch.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For outcomes based on goals, the sample size becomes smaller as the goal amount increases. Since Louise is seeking a little more than $10,000, and the data for larger goal amounts is limited, it makes the most sense to look at data that is less than $15,000. Based on data for campaigns with goals less than $15,000, it can be concluded that campaigns with smaller budgets are more likely to achieve their funding goal. Campaigns with a goal less than $1,000 had a 76% success rate, compared with campaigns in the $10,000 to $14,999 range which had a 54% success rate. The inverse relation between goal and success continues with the exception of campaigns in the $35,000-$39,999 and the $40,000-$44,999 which only have a total of nine campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data set is limited because it does not contain key variables that play a factor in success. For example, it does not have information for how many shares a campaign received on social media, or how many views a campaign received as a result links outside of the Kickstarter website. It does not capture how much time campaign creators spend advertising the campaign online and in their community. It also does not differentiate between campaigns created by organizations or groups of people versus campaigns created by individuals; this data point may be helpful for identifying the level of resources, assets, and networks that go into making a campaign successful. Inclusion of data points such as these would provide better insight into why some campaigns succeed and others fail.

## Results

Based on the data provided, I can recommend that Louise launch her campaign in May, and advise that she will have a likelier chance of succeeding with a smaller goal amount.

For further analysis of the data set, another good step would be discussing the likely donation amount Louise expects to receive from individual donors. If she does not anticipate having a few large backers, it makes sense to filter out campaigns that had a high average donation. By filtering out those campaigns, we can get a clearer look at the success rate of a subset of data that is more representative to the campaign plans to operate.
